What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps track changes in files, especially in coding projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same project, keeps a history of changes, and makes it easy to undo mistakes.

Why Use Version Control?

Tracks Changes: Keeps a record of all edits made to files.

Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project.

Backup & Restore: If something goes wrong, you can go back to an earlier version.

Branching & Merging: Work on different features separately without affecting the main code.

Types of Version Control Systems

1. Local Version Control (LVCS)

Stores different versions of files on your local computer.

Simple but doesnâ€™t support teamwork.

Example: RCS (Revision Control System).


2. Centralized Version Control (CVCS)

Uses a central server where all versions of files are stored.

Developers need to connect to the server to update or retrieve files.

If the server crashes, all history might be lost.

Examples: SVN (Subversion), CVS, Perforce.


3. Distributed Version Control (DVCS)

Every developer has a complete copy of the repository (including all history).

No need for constant internet access.

If the main server crashes, anyone with a copy can restore it.

""""Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar""""
